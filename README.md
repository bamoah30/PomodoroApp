#Pomodoro Timer App

A simple and elegant **Pomodoro Timer** built with Python and Tkinter to help boost productivity and maintain focus using the popular **Pomodoro technique**.

---

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method that breaks work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.  
After several cycles, a longer break is taken to help you recharge.

---

## Features

- Adjustable Pomodoro, short break, and long break durations  
- Automatic switching between work sessions and breaks  
- Simple graphical interface built with Tkinter  
-  Helps improve focus and productivity  
-  Plays a system beep at the end of each session  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Start the timer** by clicking the **Start Pomodoro** button.  
2. The app runs through a complete Pomodoro cycle:
   - 4 work sessions  
   - 3 short breaks  
   - 1 long break after the final cycle  
3. Each session‚Äôs countdown is displayed on screen.

##  Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

No external libraries are required ‚Äî only the built-in `tkinter`, `time`, and `threading` modules are used.

---

##  Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/bamoah30/PomodoroApp.git


 2.Navigate into the project folder:

  cd PomodoroApp


3.Run the app:

  python Pomodoroapp.py

4.Configuration

Inside the code, you can adjust the durations by modifying these constants:

WORK_MIN = 25
SHORT_BREAK_MIN = 5
LONG_BREAK_MIN = 15
CYCLES = 4


 For testing, the current version uses shorter times (in minutes).
